**What Is K-Means Clustering?**

K-means clustering is an unsuperivised machine learning algorithm used to cluster data. K-means clustering groups datapoints into k# of clusters centered around centroids (the center of each cluster). 

**Why is k-means clustering important?**

**Applications**

scRNA seq clustering 

Gene co-expression networks 

Non-biological applications 
Marketing 
geographic clustering

**Algorithm**

We iterate over the algorithm until we reach our desired results or convergence occurs.
Convergence is where the results of the algorithm no longer change. Aka. once centroid and cluster re-assignment no longer changes. 
Convergence
Determines when iteration ceases. Convergence occurs when there is no longer any change in cluster assignment and centroid location.
